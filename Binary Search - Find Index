'''
Task: Given a sorted list of integers and an integer value x as parameters, 
return the index of the largest element in the list smaller than or equal 
to x. If such an element does not exist, return -1 

Input:
lst is a sorted list of integers
x can be a float or an integer


Question:
# can the list contain negative numbers? no, 1 is the smallest number
# can the list contain 0? no, 1 is the smallest number
# is x always in integer? No. so if x is not an integer, return -1
# does it matter if lst is sorted in ascending order or descending order

Edgecases:
# every element in the list is larger than x --> return: -1
# lst is empty --> return -1
# lst has 1 item and its greater than x --> return -1
# lst has 1 item and its equal to x --> return 0
# lst has 1 item and its smaller than x --> return 0
# if x is 0 --> return -1
